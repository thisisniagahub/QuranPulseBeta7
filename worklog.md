Agent: Main Agent
Task: Clone, build, and run QuranPulse-v6.0 project

Work Log:
- Cloned QuranPulse-v6.0 from GitHub to /home/z/QuranPulse-v6.0
- Analyzed project structure: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 PWA
- Installed npm dependencies (1360 packages)
- Created .env from .env.example (placeholder Supabase credentials)
- Built the project with `vite build` (production build, 124 precache entries)
- Attempted to run Vite dev server (port 5173) but background process kept dying
- Tried Bun mini-service approach (also died after a few seconds)
- Final approach: Integrated static build into Next.js project
  - Copied dist/ contents to /home/z/my-project/public/ (root level)
  - Renamed index.html to quranpulse.html to avoid Next.js route conflict
  - Added Next.js rewrites in next.config.ts for SPA routes (/quran, /iqra, /smart-deen, /ibadah, /umrah, etc.)
  - Created page.tsx with iframe embedding the SPA
  - Updated layout metadata to QuranPulse branding
  - Disabled PWA service worker registration for embedded mode

Stage Summary:
- QuranPulse is served as a static SPA within the Next.js project
- All SPA routes work via Next.js rewrites
- All static assets (JS, CSS, images, iqra JSON data) served correctly
- App accessible at http://localhost:3000/ via Preview Panel
- Without Supabase credentials, the app shows the Landing Page (unauthenticated state)
- AuthContext has 10-second timeout that forces app to load even without backend
